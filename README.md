# UDP-server
Simulated servers, both UDP and TCP.

TCP server used as a banking transaction simulator, used for withdrawals and deposits.

UDP server used for file transfer, where a client sends an input.txt file that is broken up line by line, sent one at a time, and reassembled server-side as output.txt.
