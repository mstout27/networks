{\bf PROGRAMMING PROJECT 2\\ }
\end{center}

%\vspace{0.3in}
\noindent

In this project, you will implement the Stop-and-Wait protocol to 
transmit data from a Sender to a Receiver
in the presence of errors and packet loss. The protocol will be 
unidirectional in which data is sent in one
direction only with acknowledgments being sent in the reverse direction. 
Only positive ACKs are used. The
transmission of packets and ACKs will be done over UDP 
(that represents an unreliable network layer
channel) using fixed UDP ports.


To implement this protocol, you will write two separate
programs called {\em Sender} and {\em Receiver} which
represent the actions to be executed by the sending node and
the receiving node respectively. Both the Sender and the
Receiver must run on the host {\em cis450.cis.udel.edu},
as you will have to come in to my office
to give me a demo of your programs. For convenience, 
both the hostname and the server port number may
be hardcoded into both the Sender and Receiver, 
but this should be done in such a way that they should be
easy to change.

\begin{verbatim}
    --------------------------------------------------------
    |                   Count (2 bytes)                    |
    --------------------------------------------------------
    |           Packet Sequence Number (2 bytes)           |
    --------------------------------------------------------
    |                 Data (0 - 80 bytes)                  |
    --------------------------------------------------------
\end{verbatim}

The second field of the header is called the
packet sequence number. Each
packet transmitted by the Sender is assigned
a sequence number that alternates between 0 and 1,
in accordance with the Stop-and-Wait protocol.


Output of your program

At specific places in both your Sender and Receiver programs, you must print 
out specific messages.
The symbol ‚Äún‚Äù below refers to the sequence number of the transmitted or receiv
0 or 1), and the symbol ‚Äúc‚Äù below refers to the count (number of data bytes) in
 the transmitted or
received packet.
The messages to be printed by the Sender are:
When a new data packet numbered n is sent by the Sender:
Packet n transmitted with c data bytes
When a data packet numbered n is retransmitted by the Sender:
Packet n retransmitted with c data bytes
When a timeout expires:
Timeout expired for packet numbered n
When an ACK is received with number n:
ACK n received
When the ‚ÄúEnd of Transmission‚Äù packet is sent:
End of Transmission Packet with sequence number n transmitted with c data bytes

\begin{center}
{\bf Testing}
\end{center}

The files {\em test1.txt} and {\em test2.txt} in the directory
{\em /usa/sethi/networks/proj2} on {\em cis450.cis.udel.edu}
are sample input files that may
be used by you to test your programs.
It is strongly suggested that you first use {\em test1.txt} for
all your testing, and only if you have thoroughly debugged your
programs, then proceed with using {\em test2.txt} for further testing.

It is also suggested that you test your programs in phases using
the following configuration parameter values:

\begin{itemize}
\item Packet and ACK loss rates 0, Timeout value $n$  = 5.
\item Packet loss rate 0.2, ACK loss rate 0, Timeout value
$n$ = 5.
\item Packet loss rate 0, ACK loss rate 0.2, Timeout value
$n$ = 5.
\item Packet and ACK loss rates 0, Timeout value $n$ = 3.
\end{itemize}
