In this project, you will implement the Stop-and-Wait protocol to 
transmit data from a Sender to a Receiver
in the presence of errors and packet loss. The protocol will be 
unidirectional in which data is sent in one
direction only with acknowledgments being sent in the reverse direction. 
Only positive ACKs are used. The
transmission of packets and ACKs will be done over UDP 
(that represents an unreliable network layer
channel) using fixed UDP ports.


To implement this protocol, you will write two separate
programs called {\em Sender} and {\em Receiver} which
represent the actions to be executed by the sending node and
the receiving node respectively. Both the Sender and the
Receiver must run on the host {\em cis450.cis.udel.edu},
as you will have to come in to my office
to give me a demo of your programs. For convenience, 
both the hostname and the server port number may
be hardcoded into both the Sender and Receiver, 
but this should be done in such a way that they should be
easy to change.

\begin{verbatim}
    --------------------------------------------------------
    |                   Count (2 bytes)                    |
    --------------------------------------------------------
    |           Packet Sequence Number (2 bytes)           |
    --------------------------------------------------------
    |                 Data (0 - 80 bytes)                  |
    --------------------------------------------------------
\end{verbatim}

The second field of the header is called the
packet sequence number. Each
packet transmitted by the Sender is assigned
a sequence number that alternates between 0 and 1,
in accordance with the Stop-and-Wait protocol.
